# AI-Powered Order Management System

An intelligent order fulfillment platform that combines Order Management, Inventory Management, SLA Monitoring, Machine Learning Risk Prediction, Root Cause Analysis, AI Alerts, and AI Recommendations into a single operational dashboard.

---

# Overview

Traditional order management systems are reactive and identify delays only after SLA breaches occur.

This project introduces an AI-driven operations platform that proactively predicts delays, identifies bottlenecks, generates alerts, and recommends corrective actions before customer commitments are impacted.

# AI Workflow

Whenever a new order is created:

1. Inventory Validation
2. Order Creation
3. AI Prediction
4. Risk Classification
5. Root Cause Analysis
6. Alert Generation
7. Recommended Action Generation
8. Dashboard Update

This creates a fully automated operational intelligence workflow.

# Machine Learning Model

### Input Features

* Power
* Inventory Availability
* Queue Depth
* Machine Load
* Utilization Percentage
* QC Failures
* SLA Hours

### Outputs

* Predicted Completion Time
* Delay Probability
* Risk Level

### Risk Categories

| Risk Level | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| LOW        | Order expected within SLA      |
| MEDIUM     | Potential SLA breach risk      |
| HIGH       | High probability of SLA breach |
